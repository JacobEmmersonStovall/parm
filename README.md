# Parm

This project was generated using [Nx](https://nx.dev).

## Library selection
[awesome-nodejs] is a curated list of useful node libraries.

## Quick start

* `ng test`: run all tests
* `ng e2e`: run all e2e tests
* `ng run react:storybook`: start and watch the storybook
* `ng run react:e2e:dev`: start and watch the e2e tests
* `ng run react:e2e:update`: update the image snapshot tests

Check `package.json` and `angular.json` for more options.

## Adding capabilities to your workspace

Nx supports many plugins which add capabilities for developing different types of applications and different tools.

These capabilities include generating applications, libraries, etc as well as the devtools to test, and build projects as well.

Below are some plugins which you can add to your workspace:

- [Angular](https://angular.io)
  - `ng add @nrwl/angular`
- [React](https://reactjs.org)
  - `ng add @nrwl/react`
- Web (no framework frontends)
  - `ng add @nrwl/web`
- [Nest](https://nestjs.com)
  - `ng add @nrwl/nest`
- [Express](https://expressjs.com)
  - `ng add @nrwl/express`
- [Node](https://nodejs.org)
  - `ng add @nrwl/node`

## Generate an application

Run `ng g @nrwl/angular:app my-app` to generate an application.

> You can use any of the plugins above to generate applications as well.

When using Nx, you can create multiple applications and libraries in the same workspace.

## Generate a library

Run `ng g @nrwl/angular:lib my-lib` to generate a library.

> You can also use any of the plugins above to generate libraries as well.

Libraries are sharable across libraries and applications. They can be imported from `@parm/mylib`.

## Development server

Run `ng serve my-app` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng g component my-component --project=my-app` to generate a new component.

## Build

Run `ng build my-app` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test my-app` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).

Run `nx affected:test` to execute the unit tests affected by a change.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e my-app` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io).

Run `nx affected:e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests affected by a change.

## Understand your workspace

Run `nx dep-graph` to see a diagram of the dependencies of your projects.

## How to publish to NPM
This package publishes to NPM following the steps of [this guide](https://blog.nrwl.io/publishing-react-libraries-made-easy-d5b3d013deba).

## How to setup Cypress for visual regression testing
https://medium.com/norwich-node-user-group/visual-regression-testing-with-cypress-io-and-cypress-image-snapshot-99c520ccc595

## Generate a nest component
```sh
ng g @nestjs/schematics:provider events --sourceRoot=apps/greenroom-rest-api/src --path=app 
```

## To run a production build
```sh
npm run nx run greenroom-ui:build:production
```
and to serve in prod
```
~/node_modules/bin/ng serve greenroom-ui --allowed-hosts www.greenroomfinder.app
```

### How to setup Jenkins
Configure jenkins to push build statuses to GitHub: [jenkins-github]

## Add swagger
`nestjs` provides guide for adding [Swagger] to your nestjs app. However, we need to make some modifications in order to get it to work with `nx`.

We will extend the `webpack.config` for the project we wish to add swagger to. For specific implementation details, see the [parm/swagger], the commit that adds swagger to this project.

You can now navigate to http://localhost:3333/api to see the explorer and http://localhost:3333/api-json to see the generated json.
