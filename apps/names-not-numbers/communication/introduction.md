Dear families who have lost someone to Covid-19,

I have created a website to honor and remember the lives of those who have passed from Covid-19.

I am on a mission to give names and faces to those who have lost their lives to this disease. Your loved ones are not just numbers in a statistic. History should not remember them that way.

I hope it serves as a solemn reminder that no one, and I mean no one, is not worth protecting. I hope that it serves as a sobering warning to those who have yet to feel the gravity of this crisis.

Sincerely,
Patrick
