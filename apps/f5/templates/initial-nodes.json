You can enter whatever you want in this node, including `markdown`, React components, and more.\n\nThe website is even partially built via these nodes. For instance, the navigation menu in the sidebar is handled via a special named node called `navigation`. Here is the source text for that node:\n\n```\n<ListItem\n  button\n  component=\"a\"\n  aria-label=\"Create\"\n  href=\"/?focus=create\"\n>\n  Create\n</ListItem>\n```\n\nThere's lots of different custom React components that are allowlisted for use in a node. For example, `<DateSubtracter/>` is one that is easy to use because it does not require any props. However, some custom React components do require props. To learn what components are available (and how to use them) I recommend checking out the source code of the Markdown component [here](https://github.com/prmichaelsen/parm/blob/master/apps/f5/src/app/Markdown.tsx).\n\nBy the way, you can even see the `DateSubstracter` in action right here!\n\n---\n\n\n<DateSubtracter/>\n\n<br/>\n\n<br/>\n\n---\n\nI made this component to keep track of how long we'd been in quarantine during coronavirus.\n\nThere's lots of fancy tricks packed into this app (and complimentarily, lots of bugs). Try the dark mode!\n\nTo create a new node, just enter some text into that \"Improvise\" box and click the `+` icon.\n\nWell, that's it! Hope you liked the tour and are interested in building something neat.\n\nCheers,\n\nPatrick",
