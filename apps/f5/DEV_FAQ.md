### How do I?

#### How do I add a nav item?
> Nov 1 2020

Currently, I hardcoded a "custom nav item" id into the side bar.
The sidebar will fetch the data for that node and then use the
`Markdown` component to render it, along with any permitted React
components in that node's text. You can use this to build your own nav.

Currently, for the parm app, I just have one entry that links 
to a separate node where I include more exhaustive navigation 
options.
