### portfolio
portfolio is a card game based around the logistics of running a 
business.

#### messy notes
these notes were messily written and may
or may not have any bearing on the game

card classes:
* asset cards
* personel cards
* expense cards

skill points:
* skills in certain sectors
* e.g. programming, business
* skill "classes"
* your business is classified by the
  majority skill class _and_
* your "product", which is abstract and
  defined in a role playing style. // maybe
  // no product for now. too complex
* skills help defend from:
  * liabilities
  * however your personel must be in the correct
    position to do so
  * for instance, if you have no one with "diplomacy"
    as ceo or hr, then you are at risk to personel
    related liabilities such as law suits
* maybe this will be like a "type" instead of skill point
  let's call them "talents". they will have one "talent"
  and one "shortcoming" or "weakness"
* "talent type" and "gap type"
* 1.5x modifier for skill points applied in their talent type
* .5x modifier for skill points applied to their gap type
* skill points building up your strength and are not consumed on use
* mentors can transfer skill points to mentees without losing their own
* personel can be poached, causing the other team to gain them and
  their skill points.
* personel can be jailed or burnt out, killed, canceled
  * maybe via liability cards
* the more "skill points" the more they deplete your "assets"
  per turn

  --

a potential white liability: establish a scholarship.
all white tech cards gain 4 skill points immediately
upon entering the field

potential rule: intrinsic workers gain +1 Sk per turn
(Sk SP or SkP)?

enticement cards
// liability cards
* "trap" cards your enemy can play
* white, grey, and black liability cards
* as long as the liability is on the board,
  it is in play as a potential effect?
* some liabilities will be countdowns
* some liabilities are attached to an enemy personal
* you can have field liabilities that affect one team,
  or all teams
* you are only affected by field liabilities for which
  your team's total makeup is closest too
* ig, 2:1 white to black means black liabilities to do 
  not affect you.
* perhaps gray liabilities effect either. if you are white
  or black, you are still vulnerable to gray liabilities.
  this means a field wide liability affects _everyone_.


market force cards: maybe these cards cause
certain business to be in demand. maybe they
direct market signals for new business opportunities
or chances to distract

regulation card: represents a new clause you must abide

lobby card: allows you to influence regulation 
* legal fine card
* subpoena card 
* audit card

* law suit card
* patent card
* research card

need personel with good diplomatic or social skills
in order to survive an audit

the more cunning or moral grey your characters,
the more vulnerable to are to audits. unless you employ
upright accountants, you may be at risk


disposition:
// paradigm
// philosphy
* machiavellin
* objectionist

morals:
* white
* grey
* black

motivation?:
* represents their reward system
* intrinsinc: works for work
* monetary: works for money
* celebrity: works for recognition
* altruistic: works for good
A personel's motivation represents how
likely they are to renege on their cause or company.
For instance, an intrinsic worker who is being strung out
by money is more likely to experience burn out. an
altruistic worker will be "crowded out" if his colleagues
or employeers are too monetarily motivated

represents their likelihood for breaking rules
on their own accord

ethics:
* utilitarian
* rights
* fairness or justice
* common good
* virtue
* machiavellin
* objectivist

disposition:
* see pokemon dispositions

paradigm:
* visionary
* defensive
* aggressive

ceo dictates your paradigm

game operates on quarters instead of turns


Ethics:
Five Sources of Ethical Standards

The Utilitarian Approach
Some ethicists emphasize that the ethical action is the one that provides the most good or does the least harm, or, to put it another way, produces the greatest balance of good over harm. The ethical corporate action, then, is the one that produces the greatest good and does the least harm for all who are affected -- customers, employees, shareholders, the community, and the environment. Ethical warfare balances the good achieved in ending terrorism with the harm done to all parties through death, injuries, and destruction. The utilitarian approach deals with consequences; it tries both to increase the good done and to reduce the harm done.

The Rights Approach
Other philosophers and ethicists suggest that the ethical action is the one that best protects and respects the moral rights of those affected. This approach starts from the belief that humans have a dignity based on their human nature per se or on their ability to choose freely what they do with their lives. On the basis of such dignity, they have a right to be treated as ends and not merely as means to other ends. The list of moral rights -- including the rights to make one's own choices about what kind of life to lead, to be told the truth, not to be injured, to a degree of privacy, and so on -- is widely debated; some now argue that non-humans have rights, too. Also, it is often said that rights imply duties -- in particular, the duty to respect others' rights.

The Fairness or Justice Approach
Aristotle and other Greek philosophers have contributed the idea that all equals should be treated equally. Today we use this idea to say that ethical actions treat all human beings equally-or if unequally, then fairly based on some standard that is defensible. We pay people more based on their harder work or the greater amount that they contribute to an organization, and say that is fair. But there is a debate over CEO salaries that are hundreds of times larger than the pay of others; many ask whether the huge disparity is based on a defensible standard or whether it is the result of an imbalance of power and hence is unfair.

The Common Good Approach
The Greek philosophers have also contributed the notion that life in community is a good in itself and our actions should contribute to that life. This approach suggests that the interlocking relationships of society are the basis of ethical reasoning and that respect and compassion for all others -- especially the vulnerable -- are requirements of such reasoning. This approach also calls attention to the common conditions that are important to the welfare of everyone. This may be a system of laws, effective police and fire departments, health care, a public educational system, or even public recreational areas.

The Virtue Approach
A very ancient approach to ethics is that ethical actions ought to be consistent with certain ideal virtues that provide for the full development of our humanity. These virtues are dispositions and habits that enable us to act according to the highest potential of our character and on behalf of values like truth and beauty. Honesty, courage, compassion, generosity, tolerance, love, fidelity, integrity, fairness, self-control, and prudence are all examples of virtues. Virtue ethics asks of any action, "What kind of person will I become if I do this?" or "Is this action consistent with my acting at my best?"
